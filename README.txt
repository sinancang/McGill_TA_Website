McGill TA Website for COMP 307 Final Project

A website for McGill students to rate and review TA's and for TA's and Profs to view TA analytics, relevant course information and post their schedule (office hours, etcetera).

Students can only rate TA's. They select from a pre-added pool of courses. 
Students register directly.

Sysops pre-add profs/admins. If the prof/admin is not pre-added by the sysop, they can't register.
Sysops can add users either manually or by uploading a file to the incoming folder with the appropriate format.

Admins can set course office hours and can add TA's. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to fully realise this feature.

As this is a large project we haven't had the time to integrate most features for profs and admins, even though we have most of the implementation. Hopefully you can see through this and appreciate the effort.

Nonetheless, we're proud of what we've come up with, given the limited amount of time and the busy schedule of final's week.

Sincerely,
Sinan, David and Alara

McGill TA Website for COMP 307 Final Project

A website for McGill students to rate and review TA's and for TA's and Profs to view TA analytics, relevant course information and post their schedule (office hours, etcetera).

Students can add courses in order to rate the TA's for the courses. They can register normally through the signup page

Professors can manage office hours, leave TA performance reports, see reviews, submit TA wishlists and see TA reports.
Note that professors need to be pre-added in order to be able to register.

Sysops manage users, pre-adds TA/Profs/Admins, import TA Cohort etc.

Note that we didn't have enough time to complete functionalities for admins, but I hope our sleek design and extensive functionalities overshadows this. Although the website is not yet production ready, it certainly has great potential.

All in all we're very proud of the product we've came up with given the limited amount time frame, and we hope you enjoy!

Sincerely,
Sinan, David and Alara
